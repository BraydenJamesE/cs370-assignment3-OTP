# cs370-assignment3-OTP

Required Downloads:
    - pip install pyotp
    - pip install qrcode
    - pip install matplotlib

How to Use:
    In my submission, I have included an executable and the .py script itself. Both are used in the same way.

    To use the .py script, type 'python3 submission.py --generate-qr' or 'python3 submission.py --get-otp'.

    To use the executable, type './submission --generate-qr' or './submission --get-otp'.

Please note that I do not have an android, so all testing was done the the Google Authenticator IOS application.

Any question, please direct them to my email edwabray@oregonstate.edu; thank you very much!
